# A. Finding the Largest Element
Create a C++ Program that finds the maximum element of an array, based on the algorithm provided:

1. Start
2. Read the number of elements and call it n.
3. Initialize an empty list that can hold n numbers.
4. Repeat the following steps n times:
    - Read a number and store it in the list.
5. Initialize a variable max with the first number in the list.
6. Repeat for each remaining number in the list:
    - Compare the current number with max.
    - If the current number is greater, update max with this number.
7. Display the value of max as the maximum element.
8. End


## Sample Outputs
### Sample Output 1
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter element 0: 3
Enter element 1: 6
Enter element 2: 89
Enter element 3: 55
Enter element 4: 34
The maximum element is: 89
```
### Sample Output 2
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter element 0: 10
Enter element 1: 10
Enter element 2: 10
Enter element 3: 10
Enter element 4: 10
The maximum element is: 10
```
### Sample Output 3
```
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter element 0: 34
Enter element 1: 56
Enter element 2: 78
Enter element 3: 45
Enter element 4: 32
The maximum element is: 78
