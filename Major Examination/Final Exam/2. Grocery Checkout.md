# 2. [QUEUES] Grocery Checkout Simulation (10 pts.)

## Introduction
When people fall in line at the grocery store, the first person who lines up is the first one to be served. This is exactly how a queue works in programming, following the FIFO rule, which means First In, First Out.

## What you will do
Complete the code provided. Its output will simulate a cashier counter at a grocery store, where each item the user enters is added to a list and printed like a scanned receipt.

## Pseudocode
```
START
  DECLARE MAXITEMS as 10
  CREATE an array called basket with MAXITEMS capacity
  PROMPT user to enter number of items
  IF number is less than 1 or greater than MAXITEMS
    SHOW error message and stop
  ELSE
    FOR EACH item from 1 to number of items
      ASK for the item name (allowing spaces)
      STORE the item in the basket
      DISPLAY "Item scanned!"
      DISPLAY all scanned items so far using a loop
    END LOOP
    DISPLAY "Thank you for shopping! <3"
END
```
