# 4. [HASHING] Linear Probing for Strings (20pts.)
## What you will do
In this activity, you will run a C++ program that demonstrates **how to store strings in a hash table using linear probing**. The hash table has 10 slots, and each string will be placed in a specific slot based on a hash function. This **function adds the ASCII values of all characters in the string**, then **takes the remainder when divided by 10 to get the index**.

If the target slot is already taken, the program will look for the next available slot using **linear probing** (moving to the next index until an empty one is found). When you run the program, it will first ask how many strings you want to insert. Then, you will input the strings one by one.
 
After all inputs, the program will display the hash table, showing which slots are filled and which are still empty. If there are no more empty slots and a new string is entered, it will notify you that the hash table is full.

## Pseudocode
```
START

DEFINE constant TABLE_SIZE = 10
DECLARE array table[TABLE_SIZE] as string
INITIALIZE all elements of table to empty string

FUNCTION hashFunction(key)
  SET hash = 0
  FOR each character c in key
    ADD ASCII value of c to hash
  END FOR
  RETURN hash MODULO TABLE_SIZE
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION insert(key)
  SET index = hashFunction(key)
  SET start = index

  WHILE table[index] is not empty
    SET index = (index + 1) MODULO TABLE_SIZE
    IF index == start
      PRINT "Hash table is FULL. Could not insert key."
      RETURN
    END IF
  END WHILE

  SET table[index] = key
  PRINT "Inserted key at index"
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION displayTable()
  FOR i = 0 to TABLE_SIZE - 1
    PRINT index i and table[i] (or {empty} if it's empty)
  END FOR
END FUNCTION

// MAIN PROGRAM
PRINT "Hash Table for Strings via Linear Probing"
PROMPT user for number of strings to insert, store in n

FOR i = 1 to n
  PROMPT user to input string
  CALL insert(input string)
END FOR

CALL displayTable()

END
```
