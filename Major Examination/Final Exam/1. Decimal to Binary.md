# 1. [STACKS] Decimal to Binary Conversion (10pts.)

## Introduction
**Computers think in binary**, which is just 1s and 0s, but we’re used to counting in decimal, the **ten numbers from 0 to 9**. When we want to talk to a computer, we have to turn our decimal numbers into its binary language.

The simplest way to switch from decimal to binary is to **keep dividing the number by two**. Each time, we jot down whether we get a 0 or a 1 as the leftover piece, or the remainder. When we run out of the number to divide, we reverse the list of remainders we wrote down, and that’s our new binary number. **A stack is a cool trick to help here, since it puts the last remainder we wrote at the top, which is the first one we want to read.**

## What you will do
For this, you have to complete the code provided. The program asks the user to enter a value in decimal number system, converting to its binary form using a stack. The stack is used as a storage of the remainders of dividing the number by 2. After dividing, we pop and display the remainder in reverse order, forming the binary representation of the number.

## Pseudocode
```
START
 DECLARE a stack of integers
 PROMPT user to input a decimal number
 READ the input number

 IF number is 0
  DISPLAY "Binary: 0"
  End program

WHILE number is greater than 0
  PUSH the remainder of number divided by 2 onto the stack
  UPDATE number by dividing it by 2

 WHILE stack is not empty
  PRINT the top of the stack
  POP the top of the stack
END
```
# Sample Outputs
### Sample Output 1
```
Enter a decimal number: 5
Binary of 5 is: 101
```

## Sample Output 2
```
Enter a decimal number: 1
Binary of 1 is: 1
```

## Sample Output 3
```
Enter a decimal number: 0
Binary: 0
```
